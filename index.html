      <h2>Camping</h2>
      <p> I love to go camping I took a long trip with the dog Isla and
      I try to sneak away whenever I get the chance even if it is just overnight.
      After years in the service industry it was a great way to escape and recharge.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Sounds of Nature</li>
        <li>Solitude</li>

      </ul>
      <div class="pool">

        <p>Playing pool is another one of my favorite things. After a
        hiatus I have been playing more lately. My dad got me into the poolhall so
        I have been playing for over 30 years and have played in some professional tournaments.</p>
